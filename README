Why write a screen scraper?

    To get data that is available, but not in structured format.

What can I scrape?

    With patience, almost anything. But the more tabular the data the more straightforward it will be.

When doesn't this work?

    When you can't be certain you've found all the data (search only, no predictable urls)
